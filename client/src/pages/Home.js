/** When we load the Home component in the application, we'll execute the query for the thought data. Because this is asynchronous, just like using fetch(), Apollo's @apollo/client library provides a loading property to indicate that the request isn't done just yet. When it's finished and we have data returned from the server, that information is stored in the destructured data property. Working with Promise-based functionality in React can get cumbersome. But with the loading property, we'll be able to conditionally render data based on whether or not there is data to even display.
 
Optional chaining negates the need to check if an object even exists before accessing its properties. In this case, no data will exist until the query to the server is finished. So if we type data.thoughts, we'll receive an error saying we can't access the property of dataâ€”because it is undefined.
